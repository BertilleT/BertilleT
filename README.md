ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a student in computer science anf information system engineering, and I am currently interested by 5 fields : data, environment-computer science relation, cryptography, network, and hardware.  

- **Data** : I know Python + numpy to proccess data, R + ggplot to visualize data.  
I want to improve my knowledges in IA (what is inside the black box of machine learning algorithm ?), and to learn more about data-journalism 
#*j'ai du bon data, Le monde*.  
- **environment-computer science relation** : I know the basis of QGIS.  
I want to improve in QGIS and to learn how to model mathematically environmental pheomenon #*project LIDAR from IGN France*, #*ocean forecasting 
project from super computing center of Barcelona*, #*projects from ICGC.cat*.  
- **Cryptography** : I know the fundamentals of the main crytographic encryption algorithm (RSA, El Gammal, AES) and one lattice based post-quantum 
encryption algo.    
I want to improve in my mathematical background to go more deeper in the understanding of encryption algorithms + work more on the implementation 
part #*Tanja Lange onlice courses*.    
- **Network** : I know the OSI and TCP/IP model and the main communication protocols.  
I want to to have a cristal-clear understanding of how my machine communicates.  
- **Hardware** : I know only the components of a computer.  
I want to increase my knowledge of that.    

Tell me if you would be interested to work together on one of those fields or if you have any ressources suggestions,   
All the best,  
B
