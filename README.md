ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a student in a master of computer science investigation.  
My background is more related to data science and language processing (python, ML, words similarities measures etc), yet I would like now to improve in parallel computing and neural network. 

I am currently inpired by projects in several fields: 
- **Parallel computing** : I had an introduction course to several parallel programming models (OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA), and I would like to go further in that field. 
- In **Teledetection**, I am interested by the OCSGE project from the IGN (France). Basically the goal of this project is to categorize the type of land (artificial, or not artificial) using neural networks on geographical data. The results can be applied to measure and control soil artificialisation. 
- **Parallel computing** and **neural network** : How to parallelize neural networks computing used in teledetection ? 
- In **Data journalism**, I am interested by articles from the "J'ai du bon data" team published in the French newspaper Le monde. 
- In **Network protocols**, I am dedicated to understand all the steps that happened to a packet from my local computer to my destinator when crossing the Internet. I am currently working on a project to configure my own vpn at home. 
- **Languages learning focuses** : Regardng programming languages, I would like to to go from beginner to intermediate level in C++ programming., and regarding human languages, I would like to move from an A1/A2 to a B1 level in Catalan.

Tell me if you would be interested to work together on one of those fields or if you have any ressources suggestions,   
All the best,  
B
