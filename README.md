ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a student in a master of computer science investigation in Barcelona(Spain).  
My background is related to data science (python, ML), I would like to improve in neural network. 

I am currently inpired by projects in several fields: 
- In **Remote sensing**, I am interested by the OCSGE project from the IGN (France). Basically the goal of this project is to categorize the type of land (artificial, or not artificial) using neural networks on geographical data. The results can be applied to measure and control soil artificialisation. 
- **Parallel computing** and **neural network** : How to parallelize neural networks computing used in remote sensing ? 
- In **Data journalism**, I am interested by articles from the "J'ai du bon data" team published in the French newspaper Le monde. 
- In **Network protocols**, I am dedicated to understand all the steps that happened to a packet from my local computer to my destinator when crossing the Internet. 
- **Languages learning focuses** : Regarding programming languages, I would like to to go from beginner to intermediate level in C++ programming, and regarding human languages, I would like to move from an A1/A2 to a B1 level in Catalan.

If you would be interested to work together on one of those fields or if you have any ressources suggestions, feel free to contact me !   
All the best,  
B
